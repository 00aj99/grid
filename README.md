[GridList](http://ubervu.github.io/grid/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uberVU/grid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uberVU/grid)
====
Drag and drop library for a two-dimensional resizable and responsive list of
items

**Demo: http://ubervu.github.io/grid/**

The GridList library is split into two roles:

1. An [agnostic GridList class](src/gridList.js) that manages the
two-dimensional positions from a list of items within a virtual matrix
2. A [jQuery plugin](src/jquery.gridList.js) built on top of the GridList class
that translates the generic items positions into responsive DOM elements with
drag and drop capabilities

## GridList class

```js
var gridList = new GridList(items, {rows: 3});
```

Here are the main functions of the GridList class:

- **findPositionForItem**: Generate new positions inside a 2d grid. The
positioning algorithm places items in columns, starting from left to right,
going through each column top to bottom
- **resize**: Convert item positions from one grid size to another, maintaining
as much of their order as possible
- **moveItemToPosition**: Handle collisions when moving an item over another
- **resizeItem**: Resize an item and reposition colliding items around.
**TODO:** Currently only the width of an item (w) can be resized
- **getChangedItems**: Compare a list of items with that of a GridList instance
and return the changed items only (diff). Useful when updating item sizes and
positions in a persistent medium (e.g. syncing grid to db with minimum payload)

### Primitives

#### Item

The item is the building block of GridList, and is a plain JavaScript object.
The primary function of the GridList is to position such items
two-dimentionally. Which brings us to the composition of an item: **w** and
**h** for size, **x** and **y** for position. E.g.

```js
{w: 3, h: 1, x: 0, y: 1}
```

Note that x and y (**column** and **row**) are abstract coords inside the grid,
they are integer values starting from 0. Naturally, w and h (**width** and
**height**) also take up space in the same coordinate system, which reveals the
smallest unit of a grid: the **cell.** You could say, for example, that the
featured item above takes up three grid cells.

#### gridList.items

A GridList instance works around an array of items. It is the first parameter
of the class constructor and is always visible under the `.items` property.
Here's a list of items for a grid with three 1x1 items on a column with three
rows:

```js
[{w: 1, h: 1, x: 0, y: 0},
 {w: 1, h: 1, x: 0, y: 1},
 {w: 1, h: 1, x: 0, y: 2}]
```

#### gridList.grid

Seeing how JavaScript doesn't support multidimensional arrays, the 2d grid
inside GridList is represented by an array for columns, with each array entry
containing another array with cells for each row. __The cell is simply a pointer
to an item that occupies it, or a *null* reference if not item is sitting on
that cell's position.__ Note that more cells can point to the same item
reference, because items occupy `w * h` cells. Here's a grid
pseudo-representation:

| col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1    | 2    |      |      |
| 1    | 3    | 4    | 4    |
| 1    |      | 4    | 4    |

This grid would be generated by these items:

```js
[{w: 1, h: 3, x: 0, y: 0},
 {w: 1, h: 1, x: 1, y: 0},
 {w: 1, h: 1, x: 1, y: 1},
 {w: 2, h: 2, x: 2, y: 1}]
```

## $.fn.gridList

```js
$('.my-list').gridList({rows: 3});
```

The jQuery plugin has two main functions:

- Render the GridList on top of a list of **DOM elements.** The list items are
expected to have `data-w` and `data-h` attributes, and optionally `data-x` and
`data-y` (if their positions have been previously generated and persisted)
- **Drag and drop** capabilities

The rendered list is **responsive** to its parent container, meaning that the
width and height of the items are calculated based on the container height
divided by the number of grid rows.

## FAQ: Why not [gridster](https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js)?

- Their README reads Ducksboard is no longer active in their development. There
are a few notable forks but it's hard to assert their [reliability.](https://github.com/dustmoo/gridster.js/issues)
- gridster works vertically and our design is horizontal. We instigated a
gridster pull request that attempted to make gridster work both ways and it
didn't seem to stabilize any time soon, plus the code was too complex to
approach. Our lib ended up having less than 5 times fewer code.
- gridster collisions are [very basic](https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/54),
we pushed towards better UX and found alternative ways for dealing with
collisions.
- We wanted out-of-the-box responsiveness, and the entire grid system was build
fluid, relative to any parent container.
- We needed the grid logic to be a DOM-less lib outside the jQuery plugin. This
allows us to compute grid positions on the server-side and run kick-ass fast
tests with Node.
- Another more particular thing we needed was widgets that had height=0, which
means they stretch on however many rows a grid has. We show timelines like
this. The same can be easily adapted for width in vertical grids.

investigating these assumptions.*
